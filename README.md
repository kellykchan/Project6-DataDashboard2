# Web Development Project 6 - *Rick and Morty Characters - Data Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Kelly Chan**

This web app: **lets you easily browse through all the Rick and Morty characters. You can search by name, filter by status or species, and even pick how many episodes a character shows up in. It also shows some quick stats like how many characters there are and status of those characters, and there's two main statistic charts to show the different spreads of Species and Status. Plus, you get to see their pictures and basic info in a simple, clean layout, or when you click on their names, you get to find more details about them. It’s a fun way to check out your favorite (or weirdest) characters from the show!**

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## Notes

Building this app had its challenges. Figuring out how to fetch data and update the UI smoothly took some trial and error, especially with routing to show character details. Moving styles from inline to CSS was a bit tricky but made the code cleaner. Adjusting the charts so long names didn’t get cut off or overlap took some tweaking. Adding an About page and extra info on the dashboard helped make the app easier to use.
